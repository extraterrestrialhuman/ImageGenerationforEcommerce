# Image Generation for E-commerce

## Project Overview

This project focuses on enhancing e-commerce platforms through generative AI techniques. It aims to improve product image quality and provide virtual try-on experiences to boost customer engagement and satisfaction.

### Use Cases

#### Product Image Augmentation

**Problem Statement:** E-commerce platforms often struggle with limited and inconsistent product images, affecting sales and customer trust.

**Solution:** Utilize a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to augment existing product images. This involves generating diverse, high-quality images to enrich product listings.

#### Virtual Try-On Experiences

**Problem Statement:** Customers are hesitant to buy apparel online due to concerns about fit and appearance.

**Solution:** Implement a virtual try-on feature using generative AI. This allows customers to visualize products on themselves, enhancing confidence in online purchases and reducing return rates.

## Methodology

### Product Image Augmentation

**Dataset Preparation:**
- The project uses the Fashion MNIST dataset as an example for training the GAN. Images are resized to 64x64 pixels, normalized, and converted to tensors for processing.

**GAN Architecture:**
- **Generator:** Creates new images from random noise to mimic real product images.
- **Discriminator:** Distinguishes between real and generated images to improve the generator's output quality.

### Virtual Try-On

**Training the cGAN:**
- The conditional GAN (cGAN) is trained to map user images with product features, enabling virtual try-on functionality.

**Implementation:**
- Product images are overlaid onto user-uploaded photos using OpenCV, respecting the product's transparency for a realistic try-on experience.

## Usage

1. **Dataset Preparation:** Download and preprocess the Fashion MNIST dataset.
2. **Training the GAN:** Execute the training script to train the GAN models for image augmentation.
3. **Virtual Try-On:** Use the provided script to perform virtual try-on with user-uploaded images and trained models.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Torchvision
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
